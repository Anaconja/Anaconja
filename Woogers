[14:47:51] PorygodOfSeizures: think of the children when they see Aggronite Stakataka
[14:48:25] PorygodOfSeizures: nvm
[14:48:29] Kyubiisaan: shouldn't aggronite stakataka be pure steel? why is it showing half rock
[14:48:42] PorygodOfSeizures: I wish it took his rock type just like aggron
[14:48:42] #E4 Flint: i thought it reomved 2nd type
[14:48:49] CrimsonSchzoidMan: bc its Rock type is listed first
[14:48:50] Kyubiisaan: it should, right?
[14:49:02] PorygodOfSeizures: what Crimson said
[14:49:04] MarieDragovia: aggron is
[14:49:08] CrimsonSchzoidMan: Therefore Rock is its primary type and Steel is what woud be replaced
[14:49:08] MarieDragovia: steel/rock
[14:49:12] MarieDragovia: staka is rock/steel
[14:49:17] #E4 Flint: i feel like
[14:49:20] #E4 Flint: its type should not change

[14:50:02] +drampas@~@grandpa: staka becomes rock/steel with aggronite
[14:50:03] #Chloe: Steel/rock to get full steel adds more steel
[14:50:11] #Chloe: does not remove the rock
[14:50:08] +Kris: i mean in game
[14:50:16] +Kris: aggronite just removes aggron's secondary typing
[14:50:22] +Kris: but oh well
[14:50:35] #E4 Flint: that's what it ought to do then tbh
[14:50:44] #E4 Flint: charizard aggronite is pure fire

[17:41:59] free my man tele: Several wise men sat around the table, hotly debating whether Mega Rayquaza should remain in Balanced Hackmons. Some of the men talked about how much of a presence it had been in OMPL, while others pointed to its lack of counters in practice.
[17:42:19] free my man tele: One of the men, who was slightly younger than the others, suddenly stood up and said
[17:42:32] free my man tele: "What if you, however, just use Audino-Mega with Unaware? Triage is defeated, and then that proves that even it’s most powerful set, as you put it, is walled by none other than a Nurse’s aid. While Nurse Joy would be excited to hear this,
[17:42:37] free my man tele: I am sure anyone hoping to ban Rayquaza-Mega due to being 'overpowered' would simply stand slack jawed before sitting-down... ultimately corrected into submission."
[17:44:17] free my man tele: After the young man was cast out of the debate, he was disappointed with not only their rudeness but his own lack of skill. He wanted to see how well he could improve in order to show the others that he was a good BH player after all.
[17:44:42] free my man tele: His morale was lifted after he met a stranger who told him "[17:37:01] Rayman Origin: you can at least guess the guy in front of you is never 2 steps in front of you if you can mindgame a bit ;)"

[23:14:49] free my man tele: actually tho im pretty sure all swear words are fine here outside of 2 things
[23:14:53] free my man tele: slurs and insulting other users
[23:15:15] %stresh: fuck free my man tele he's a free my man tele
